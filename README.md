# Metro-Platform-Project
This is a simple C++ project, which uses Graphs and Heap kind of data structures and Dijkstra Algorithm to answer queries related to a hypothetical metro model, 
It answers queries like finding shortest path wrt to distance and time between two metro stations and provides exact distance and time required.
